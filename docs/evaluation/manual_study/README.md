## 1. Objective & Scope

This packet prepares the experimental and operational materials required to execute the approved **Manual Baseline Study Protocol** ([`docs/evaluation/protocol.md`](../protocol.md) §5).

The manual baseline study measures human operator velocity, cognitive workload, and error rates when reconciling wholesale purchase orders without automated software. These empirical measurements will serve as the auditable point of comparison against OrderShield's automated and assisted processing under Success Criteria **SC-001**, **SC-002**, and **SC-003**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Study Preparation Phase Only (`VLD-EVAL-03A`)**:
> - **Zero Participant Results Fabricated**: No synthetic, estimated, or fictitious participant measurements are recorded in this packet.
> - **Zero Participant Execution Conducted**: Participant runs will occur only after explicit review and approval at Human Gate **HG-EVAL-03A**.
> - **Zero Application/Runtime Changes**: Application code, domain logic, and API behavior remain untouched.
> - **Zero Marketing Claims Updated**: Top-level `README.md` claims remain strictly unchanged until empirical results are committed.
> - **Zero LIVE Calls**: No external network or live LLM provider invocations are made.

## 3. Canonical Study Cases

Participants will evaluate exactly the three approved study cases in the specified canonical order:

1. **Case A**: [`docs/evaluation/fixtures/sc001_prepared_5line_po.txt`](../fixtures/sc001_prepared_5line_po.txt)
   - Synthetic 5-line purchase order for Acme Industrial Supplies (`CUST-ACME`).
   - Standardized velocity benchmark fixture for SC-001.
2. **Case B**: [`tests/fixtures/po_discrepancy_apex.txt`](../../../tests/fixtures/po_discrepancy_apex.txt)
   - Stateful 2-line purchase order for Apex Distribution (`CUST-APEX`).
   - Contains price discrepancy, ambiguous catalog description, and latent MOQ violation.
3. **Case C**: [`tests/fixtures/po_ambiguous_apex.txt`](../../../tests/fixtures/po_ambiguous_apex.txt)
   - 1-line purchase order for Apex Distribution (`CUST-APEX`).
   - Contains an ambiguous product description requiring clarification routing.

*Note: No alternative, simplified, or substituted cases may be used.*

## 4. Participant Protocol & Boundaries

### Permitted Tools
- Desktop or handheld calculator.
- Basic spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) used purely as a display/scratchpad.
- Text editor or document viewer for reading text files.

### Prohibited Tools
- OrderShield web application, API, or database.
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or any other LLM / AI tool.
- Automated reconciliation scripts or regex matching tools.
- Collaboration with other participants or observers.
- Answer keys or ground-truth manifests.

### Execution & Timing Rules
- **Timer Start**: The exact timestamp when the participant opens the PO file and reference sheets.
- **Timer Stop**: The exact timestamp when the participant submits the completed reconciliation template.
- **Execution Order**: Cases must be reconciled independently in the strict order: **Case A $\to$ Case B $\to$ Case C**.

---

## 5. Participant Eligibility & Cohort Design

- **Cohort Size**: 2 to 3 independent human participants.
- **Eligibility Requirement**: Participants must have **no prior knowledge** of the test cases, fixtures, ground-truth manifest, or application reconciliation implementation.
- **Sample Characterization**: Small convenience sample. Participants must not be described as professional wholesale coordinators unless factually true.
- **Privacy & Anonymity**:
  - Non-identifying IDs: `P01`, `P02`, `P03`.
  - Neutral background category: e.g., `"student"`, `"developer"`, `"administrative experience"`.
  - No PII (names, emails, phone numbers) is collected or stored.

---

## 6. Objective Error Scoring

Observer scoring is strictly objective and based on the approved error classifications:
1. **Missed Price Mismatch**: Fails to flag when requested unit price differs from contract tier price.
2. **Missed MOQ Violation**: Fails to flag when requested quantity is below catalog MOQ.
3. **Missed Package Violation**: Fails to flag when quantity violates packaging increment.
4. **Missed Arithmetic Error**: Fails to flag discrepancy between `qty * price` and stated line total.
5. **Incorrect SKU Assignment**: Assigns an arbitrary SKU to an ambiguous description instead of routing for customer clarification.

*Subjective scoring is prohibited.*

---

## 7. Deterministic Aggregation Plan

Before collecting any data, the aggregation methodology is pre-committed:

### Per-Case Aggregation
- **Durations**: Collect $[d_1, d_2, \dots, d_N]$ and calculate the median ($p50$).
- **Error Count**: Sum of all missed discrepancies and incorrect SKU assignments across the cohort.
- **Catch Rate**: $\frac{\sum \text{Correctly Identified Discrepancies}}{N \times \text{Seeded Discrepancies}} \times 100\%$.

### Overall Manual Batch Aggregation
- **Total Duration per Participant**: $T_i = d_{A,i} + d_{B,i} + d_{C,i}$.
- **Median Total Batch Duration**: $\text{median}([T_1, \dots, T_N])$.
- **Batch Catch Rate**: $\frac{\sum \text{Total Caught}}{4N} \times 100\%$.
- **Explicit Sample Size**: Reported explicitly as $N=2$ or $N=3$.

### Scientific Integrity & Claims Constraints
- No extrapolation to industry-wide operator baselines.
- No invented cost-savings or margin-recovery dollar projections.
- No claims of statistical significance from small convenience cohorts.

## 8. SC-001 Assisted OrderShield Run Protocol

A dedicated section of [`observer_recording_template.md`](./observer_recording_template.md) prepares the assisted OrderShield timing measurement:
- **Canonical Fixture**: `docs/evaluation/fixtures/sc001_prepared_5line_po.txt`
- **Timer Start**: Operator initiates submission of the prepared 5-line PO in the OrderShield UI.
- **Timer Stop**: Approval is completed and the `Verified Order` result is visibly returned.
- **SC-001 Pass Condition**: Actual assisted duration $< 60.0$ seconds (FAIL if $\ge 60.0$ seconds).
- **Status in EVAL-03A**: Strictly left blank (`NOT_YET_MEASURED`).
- **Intake Path Precondition**: The current application has no accepted replay extraction asset for `sc001_prepared_5line_po.txt`. Therefore, `clean_acme` must **not** be substituted, and system timing must **not** be fabricated. Execution requires a separate, explicit project decision regarding the 5-line intake path.

---

## 9. Study Design & Contamination Guard

To protect measurement validity:
- **Preferred Cohort Separation**:
  - Manual baseline participants: 2–3 individuals with zero prior answer knowledge.
  - Assisted SC-001 operator: A separate individual who has not manually reconciled Case A beforehand.
- **Contamination Disclosure**: If resource constraints necessitate using the same person for both manual reconciliation of Case A and the assisted OrderShield run, this familiarity bias must be documented explicitly in the observer log and final report.
